- **Project Summary**: 
This research explores decision-making under risk in the context of the "Invest or Keep" game. It develops a new solution concept that combines the risk aversion of the players and the trade-off between risk and reward. The proposed solution concept goes beyond traditional equilibrium concepts by considering the influence of risk preferences on decision-making. The research provides opinions on how players make investment decisions and highlights the importance of risk aversion in strategic thinking. The findings have applications in investment decision-making, risk management, and the design of behavioral interventions.

### Model

It is static, normal form game of imperfect information. The game involves two players, Player A and Player B, who make simultaneous decisions without knowing the other player's choice. Each player has two options: "Invest" or "Keep." The game is played in a single round, and the outcome is determined based on the players' choices.
