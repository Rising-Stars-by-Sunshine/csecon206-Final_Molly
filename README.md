- **Project Summary**: 
This research explores decision-making under risk in the context of the "Invest or Keep" game. It develops a new solution concept that combines the risk aversion of the players and the trade-off between risk and reward. The proposed solution concept goes beyond traditional equilibrium concepts by considering the influence of risk preferences on decision-making. The research provides opinions on how players make investment decisions and highlights the importance of risk aversion in strategic thinking. The findings have applications in investment decision-making, risk management, and the design of behavioral interventions.

### Model

It is static, normal form game of imperfect information. The game involves two players, Player A and Player B, who make simultaneous decisions without knowing the other player's choice. Each player has two options: "Invest" or "Keep." The game is played in a single round, and the outcome is determined based on the players' choices.

- self-introduction
Senior at Duke Kunshan Univirsity, has an interest in econ, finance, behavior science. Now trying hard to learn CS.
- Final reflections 
  For intellectual growth, I combined computer science and economic thinking to solve real-life issues. I gained a deeper understanding of how machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to predict decision-making. Because besides economy and finance, I am also interested in behavioral science, the course provides me with the knowledge and skills to further explore or prove some of the arguments I believe to be true. And by exploring the intersection of machine learning, social sciences, and economics, I found the magic of interdisciplinary research is to create innovative solutions. For example, the o-tree software skill I learned in class helped me to combine CS and behavioral science.
